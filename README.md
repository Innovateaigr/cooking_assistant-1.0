Cooking Assistant - Version 1.0
A Cooking Assistant that helps answer common cooking questions, provides substitutions, and shares techniques, recipes, and tips. This interactive assistant is built with Python, Flask, and Hugging Face's RAG model, showcasing contextual memory and response generation for a conversational experience.

Project Overview
This project is a cooking assistant capable of answering questions on various cooking topics. It searches a knowledge base for relevant answers and uses Hugging Face’s RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model to generate responses when it doesn't find an exact match.

Features
Substitution Suggestions: Offers alternative ingredients for common substitutions.
Quick Tips & Techniques: Shares basic cooking techniques and answers frequently asked questions.
Simple UI: A frontend interface for easy question submission and interaction.
Dynamic Responses: Uses contextual understanding and RAG to answer questions beyond the provided knowledge base.

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Redis (Optional for future contextual memory implementation)
Libraries:
transformers
Flask
rapidfuzz
datasets
faiss-cpu
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Innovateaigr/cooking_assistant-1.0.git
cd cooking_assistant
Set Up a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv cooking_env
source cooking_env/bin/activate   # On Windows: cooking_env\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the Assistant: Open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to interact with the cooking assistant.

Usage
Asking Questions:

Enter cooking-related questions like:
“What can I use instead of eggs?”
“How do I make a quick pasta sauce?”
The assistant retrieves responses from the local knowledge base and provides answers directly or generates them if the question is new.
Interactivity:

Use the FAQ section to explore common questions.
See response suggestions based on context (e.g., substitutions or recipes).
Enjoy real-time response generation.
Future Enhancements:

Contextual Memory: Track user questions and answers for multi-turn conversations.
Multi-Turn Conversations: Store conversation history to allow follow-up questions.
Future Development (Planned)
In upcoming versions, we plan to add:

Redis Integration for storing user sessions and contextual memory.
Enhanced Response Generation with fine-tuning or dataset-specific training.
Multi-Turn Conversations to improve the user experience by remembering context.
